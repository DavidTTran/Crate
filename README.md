## Project Learning Goals
- Learn and apply strategies for understanding how to analyze a larger, existing code base
- Apply strategies for reading and evaluating documentation
- Explore and implement new concepts, patterns, or libraries that have not been explicitly taught while at Turing
- Practice an advanced, professional git workflow


## Improving UX and Community
Our Group added a feature that allows users to edit their Profile page.  Users can add an image, update their shipping address, add a personal description, and also change their name and email.
