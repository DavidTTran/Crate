// I don't really know we're going to implement the subscriptions..
// At the moment, there's nothing that triggers subscriptions being sent
// So maybe as an admin we have a button that sends all subscriptions?
// So we'd also need to track the number of times a subscription is sent to a user..

// Part of the story wants us to display what items the user keeps..
// Do we have to build that functionality? Adding items to subscriptions/crates
